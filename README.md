# pyIPTV_Buddy
Python script to parse iptv m3u files and send url to vlc player

These variables need to be completed prior to running, this will be handled more intelligently in later revisions

m3u_url = 'http://yadayada.co.uk/your_m3u_url_goes_here'
_vlc = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe'
